</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Discuss these questions briefly, based on the info in the case. No need to quantitatively answer these questions.

<ol>
<li>Describe LTCM‚Äôs investment strategy with regard to the following aspects: ‚Ä¢ Securities traded
‚Ä¢ Trading frequency

‚Ä¢ Skewness (Do they seek many small wins or a few big hits?) ‚Ä¢ Forecasting (What is behind their selection of trades?)
</li>
<li>What are LTCM‚Äôs biggest advantages over its competitors?</li>
<li>The case discusses four types of funding risk facing LTCM:
‚Ä¢ collateral haircuts ‚Ä¢ repo maturity

‚Ä¢ equity redemption ‚Ä¢ loan access

The case discusses specific ways in which LTCM manages each of these risks. Briefly discuss them.
</li>
<li>LTCM is largely in the business of selling liquidity and volatility. Describe how LTCM accounts for liquidity risk in their quantitative measurements.</li>
<li>Is leverage risk currently a concern for LTCM?</li>
<li>Many strategies of LTCM rely on converging spreads. LTCM feels that these are almost win/win situations because of the fact that if the spread converges, they make money. If it diverges, the trade becomes even more attractive, as convergence is still expected at a future date.
What is the risk in these convergence trades?

3 The FX Carry Trade

Find an Excel data file, ‚Äúfx carry data.xlsx‚Äù. The file has two sets of data:

<ul>
<li>Risk-free rates across 5 currencies, as measured by annualized 3-month LIBOR rates.</li>
<li>Spot FX rates, as direct quotes to the USD. (Note that all currencies are quoted as USD per the foreign currency.)
For use in the homework, note the following:
</li>
</ul>
‚Ä¢ For risk-free rate data, rf,i , the rate is known and reported in the data at time t. Namely,

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
t,t+1

any given date t in the data file is reporting both Si and rf,i .

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
t t,t+1

<ul>
<li>The theory says to use log risk-free rates. You have the risk-free rate in levels: use the following
equation to convert them:

rf,i = ln(1 + rf,i ) t,t+1 t,t+1
</li>
<li>The theory says to use log spot FX prices. You have the FX prices in levels, so directly take their logarithims:
sit = ln(Sti)
</li>
</ul>
1. The Static Carry Trade

Define the log return of holding the foreign currency using log values of the risk-free rate and log values of the FX rates:

ri ‚â° si ‚àí si + rf,i t+1 t+1 t t,t+1

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Then the excess log return relative to USD, is expressed as

ÃÉri ‚â° si ‚àí si + rf,i ‚àí rf,$

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
t+1 t+1 t t,t+1 t,t+1

For each foreign currency, i, calculate the excess log return series, ÃÉrt+1. Report the following

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
stats, (based on the excess log returns.) Annualize them.

(a) mean (b) volatility

(c) Sharpe ratio

What differences do you see across currencies?

2. Implications for UIP:

(a) Do any of these stats contradict the (log version) of Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP)? (b) A long position in which foreign currency offered the best Sharpe ratio over the sample?

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
(c) Are there any foreign currencies for which a long position earned a negative excess return (in USD) over the sample?

3. Predicting FX

For each foreign currency, test whether interest-rate differentials can predict growth in the

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
foreign-exchange rate.1 Do this by estimating the following forecasting regression:: si ‚àísi =Œ±i+Œ≤iÙè∞Ñrf,$ ‚àírf,i Ùè∞Ö+Œµi

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
t+1 t t,t+1 t,t+1 t+1

where rf,i denotes the risk-free rate of currency i, and si denotes the FX rate for currency i.

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Again, note that both rf,$ and st are determined at time t. t,t+1

<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;Make a table with columns corresponding to a different currency regression. Report the regression estimates Œ±i and Œ≤i in the first two rows. Report the R2 stat in the third row.</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Suppose the foreign risk-free rate increases relative to the US rate.
<ol>
<li>For which foreign currencies would we predict a relative strengthening of the USD in the following period?</li>
<li>For which currencies would we predict relative weakening of the USD in the following period?</li>
<li>This FX predictability is strongest in the case of which foreign currency?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
4. The Dynamic Carry Trade

Use this to write Et Ùè∞Ç ÃÉrit+1Ùè∞É as a function of the interest-rate differential as well as Œ± and Œ≤ from this FX regression.

Et[st+1 ‚àíst]=Œ±+Œ≤Ùè∞Ñrf,$ ‚àírf,i Ùè∞Ö t,t+1 t,t+1

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Then use the definition of excess (log) returns on FX:

ÃÉri =s ‚àís‚àíÙè∞Ñrf,$ ‚àírf,i Ùè∞Ö

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
t+1 t+1 t t,t+1 t,t+1 Rearranging, this implies the following forecast for excess log returns:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
EtÙè∞Ç ÃÉrit+1Ùè∞É=Œ±+(Œ≤‚àí1)Ùè∞Ñrf,$ ‚àírf,i Ùè∞Ö t,t+1 t,t+1

<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;Use your regression estimates from Problem 3 along with the formula above to calculate the fraction of months for which the estimated FX risk premium positive. That is, for each i, calculate how often in the time-series we have
Et Ùè∞Ç ÃÉrit+1Ùè∞É &gt; 0
</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;Which currencies most consistently have a positive FX risk premium? And for which
currencies does the FX risk premium most often go negative?
</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;Explain how we could use these conditional risk premia to improve the static carry trade returns calculated in Problem 1.</li>
</ol>
1Note that st+1 ‚àí st is a log-growth rate in the USD per foreign currency, which indicates USD depreciation. 4

4 Interest Rates and the Expectations Hypothesis

This section is not graded, and you do not need to submit your answers. We may discuss some of these extensions.

<ul>
<li>Use the data file, ‚Äútreasury data.xlsx.‚Äù We will only use the ‚Äúprices‚Äù tab. (Though yields are provided, we will calculate log yields below.)</li>
<li>Remember that this is monthly data, so the notation below measures t in months.</li>
<li>But the maturities are years, so the notation below measures n in years.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Log yields
(a) Use the price data, P (n) , (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to calculate the time series of log yields denoted t

y(n) for n = 1,2,3,4,5. t

(b) Report the mean and volatility of (log) yields for each maturity. (c) Plot all five time series of yields together on one graph.
</li>
<li>Log forward rates

(a) Calculate the time-series of log forward rates: f (n‚Üín+1) for n = 1, 2, 3, 4.)

(b) Report the mean and volatility of (log) forwards for each maturity. (c) Plot the time series of forward rates together on one graph
</li>
<li>Log returns
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;Calculate the time series of excess (log) one-year returns for the bonds of each maturity. Note that the returns of maturity 1 are the risk-free rate, so you are calculating returns for n = 2, 3, 4, 5 in excess of this, by subtracting the returns for n = 1.

Be careful to use the formula from the lecture!2</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;For each series of excess log returns, report the following (annualized) statistics: ‚Ä¢ mean volatility Sharpe ratio</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;Report the correlation matrix of the 4 excess bond returns.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Are any of the basic statistics above evidence for or against the strict version of the Expectations Hypothesis?</li>
<li>Test the Expectations Hypothesis with the regression test explained in the Lecture Note. Using your calculations from above, run the regressions</li>
</ol>
r(n) ‚àí y(1) =Œ± + Œ≤ Ùè∞Ñf((n‚àí1)‚Üín) ‚àí y(1)Ùè∞Ö + Œµt+1 t+1t t t

Do this for n = 2,3,4.

(a) For each maturity, report

‚Ä¢ Œ± Œ≤ R-squared

(b) Whatdoyourpointestimatesimplyaboutthe3statementsoftheExpectationsHypothesis?

2You must keep track of the fact that the bond ages: thus the one-year return on a 5-year bond involves the price of the 5-year bond and the price of the 4-year bond. This is why we must calculate one-year returns rather than monthly returns.
